# String Manipulation
## Question 1
### Return Something to Me!
Write a function that returns the string `"something"` joined with a space `" "` and the given argument `a`.
Examples:
```
giveMeSomething("is better than nothing") ➞ "something is better than nothing"

giveMeSomething("Bob Jane") ➞ "something Bob Jane"

giveMeSomething("something") ➞ "something something"
```

## Question 2
### Word without First Character
Create a function that takes a word and returns the new word without including the first character.

Examples
```
newWord("apple") ➞ "pple"

newWord("cherry") ➞ "herry"

newWord("plum") ➞ "lum"
```
