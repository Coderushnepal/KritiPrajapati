# Ability Test

## Question 1

Consider the following problem:

```
Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 

For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
```

## Question 2

Find the Smallest and Biggest Numbers
Create a function that takes an array of numbers and return both the minimum and maximum numbers, in that order.

```
minMax([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ [1, 5]

minMax([2334454, 5]) ➞ [5, 2334454]

minMax([1]) ➞ [1, 1]
```
